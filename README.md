## Hi there! 👋
I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) and a research assistant in the [Madison Security & Privacy Research Group](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/), advised by [Dr. Patrick McDaniel](https://patrickmcdaniel.org/)

🔬 My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning. I'm also interested in its explanability and broad implication in security and privacy.
- Security of agentic AI systems
- Robustness of model architectures & training strategies

I also enjoy table tennis🏓, snowboarding🏂, hiking🏞️, and biking🚵!

Feel free to reach out!
